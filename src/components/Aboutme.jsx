            Hello, I'm Akash Shravan Nikam, a passionate tech enthusiast on a
            journey of innovation and continuous learning. Currently pursuing a
            Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (Honours
            in Cyber Security), I thrive on building cutting-edge tech projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            With hands-on experience as a MERN stack developer, frontend web
            developer, and Python programmer, I have contributed to projects
            like eCommerce full-stack applications and core web applications. My
            tech toolkit includes Java, Python, MERN Stack, SQL, HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new places, enhancing
            my cricket skills, and immersing myself in podcasts. Let's connect
            and create the future together! ðŸš€
